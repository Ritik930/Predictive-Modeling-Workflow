# Predictive-Modeling-Workflow


This repository demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for building a predictive model. The project includes data loading, cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Steps in the Workflow

1. **Load the Dataset**  
   Import data from a reliable source into the environment for analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   Handle missing values, remove inconsistencies, and resolve errors to ensure data quality.

3. **Data Exploration**  
   Analyze trends, patterns, and correlations using statistical and visualization techniques.

4. **Feature Engineering**  
   Select and transform variables to improve model performance and accuracy.

5. **Data Splitting**  
   Divide the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate the model effectively.

6. **Model Training**  
   Train a predictive model using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Neural Networks).

7. **Model Evaluation**  
   Measure model accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics to assess reliability.

8. **Prediction**  
   Use the trained model to predict future trends on new or unseen data.

## Repository Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains scripts for each step in the workflow.
- **`data/`**: Stores the raw dataset, cleaned dataset, and new data for predictions.
- **`notebooks/`**: Includes Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis and modeling.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Specifies the Python libraries required to run the project.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation
  - `numpy`: Numerical operations
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: Data visualization
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning
